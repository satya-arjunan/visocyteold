This plugin was further integrated in the Visocyte sources with the help of
Joachim Pouderoux (joachim.pouderoux@kitware.com) and
Mathieu Westphal (mathieu.westphal@kitware.com) from Kitware.

GmshReader Plugin is inspired from an existing Visocyte reader able to
read unstructured grid data under the PHASTA format. See the original version
of this reader already implemented in the Visocyte source code (.pht extension),
or a second version currently implemented as an external plugin (.phts extension)
and available from https://github.com/PHASTA/VisocyteSyncIOReaderPlugin.
